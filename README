README

ngctl was born out of a need to quickly and easily set a downtime on an alerting host without having to navigate a web interface.  That morphed into a bigger project to allow setting more specific downtime entries such as a specific service on a specific host, and maybe for a specific time in the future.

Over time this grew to also supporting acknowledging problems, and enabling or disabling checks and notifications.
It now supports querying Nagios via a predefined set of queries in a configuration file (ngctlq.conf) and also removing downtime entries by ID or by using some or all of the paramaters used to add the downtime entry.

It's always a work in progress, but it does work.


Prerequisites:
    The Nagios instance must also have Livestatus installed
    The user running the command needs r/w access to both the Nagios command socket and the Livestatus pipe
        The locations of the sock and pipe must be specified in the script
    Normally included dependancies: grep printf unixcat (from Livestatus) 


Use

ngctl currently works in several modes
 * down             add a host or service downtime
 * up               remove a host or service downtime
 * rd               remove a host or service downtime by ID
 * ack              acknowledge host or service problems
 * dn               Disable host or service notifications
 * en               Enable host or service notifications
 * dc               Disable host or service checks
 * ec               Enable host or service checks
 * sc               Schedule host or service check
 * query            Uses the ngctlq.conf file to query Nagios via Livestatus

 Use:   ngctl <mode> options parameters
 (if mode is not specified, 'down' is the default)

Specifying hostnames

There are 3 ways to specify hostnames (although methods 1 and 2 can be combined however you like)
    1 Specify a hostname using the -h parameter.  You can specify this multiple time, or specify multiple hostnames by quoting a space delimtered list. eg:
        -h=prodapiserver01
        -h=prodapiserver01 -h=prodapiserver02 -h=prodapiserver03
        -h='prodapiserver01 prodapiserver02 prodapiserver03'

    2 Specify a Nagios hostgroup using the -H parameter.  You can specify this multiple time, or specify multiple hostgroups by quoting a space delimtered list. eg:
        -H=redhat-servers
        -H=redhat-servers -H=centos-servers
        -H='redhat-servers centos-servers'

    3 Specify a hostname template* using the -h parameter and a range of numbers to append to the template.  You may only specify 1 hostname template and 1 range.  eg:
        -h=prodwebserver -x=1 -y=10
            generates a list of hostnames like this: prodwebserver01 prodwebserver02 prodwebserver03 ... prodwebserver10
        -h=prodwebserver -x=1 -y=10 -p=odd
            generates a list of hostnames like this: prodwebserver01 prodwebserver03 prodwebserver05 ... prodwebserver09
        -h=prodwebserver -x=1 -y=10 -p=even
            generates a list of hostnames like this: prodwebserver02 prodwebserver04 prodwebserver06 ... prodwebserver10

        * this assumes the naming convention of servers requires hostname to end in a 2 or more digit number (currently a requirement #todolist)
        * use -o to override this hostname check if you aren't specifying a range

You can mix -h with -H as many times as you like as long as you aren't trying to use the template/range method. If you're using the template/range method you can only specify each parameter once.

You can't...
    -h=prodapiserver01 -h=prodwebserver -x=1 -y=10
    This is not currently supported as it tries to use a specific hostname as well as a template and range

    -H=redhat-servers -h=prodwebserver -x=1 -y=10
    This is not currently supported as it tries to use a hostgroup as well as a template and range

    -h=prodwebserver -h=prodapiserver -x=1 -y=10
    This is not currently supported as it tries to use more than 1 template

You can...
    -h='prodapiserver01 prodapiserver02' -H=prod-webservers


ngctl will remove duplicate hostnames from the list of hostnames, so if you're mixing hostgroups and hostnames only 1 downtime will be created for each host.



Specifying the time frame

Start time
    If you want the start time of the downtime entry to be "now", don't specify a start time - "now" will be assumed
    Use the -b parameter to specify a start time in the future.  Values must be compatible with the GNU/linux 'date' command

End time
    To specify a duration rather than a specific end time, use -d for minutes and/or -D for hours
    To specify a specific end time, use the -e parameter.  Values must be compatible with the GNU/linux 'date' command
    You can't specify an end time and a duration as it doesn't make sense

    Some valid examples for -b and -e are:
        -b='Tomorrow 10am'
        -b='Wednesday 10am'
        -b='2019-03-05 10am'
        -e='tomorrow'
            this will add 24 hours to the current time
        -e='next week'
            this will add 7 days to the current time

    Using a duration:
        -d=30
            end time is 30 minutes after the start time
        -D=1
            end time is 1 hour after the start time
        -d=30 -D=1
            end time is 1 hour and 30 minutes after the start time 

    Valid examples:
        -d=30
            set downtime starting now for 30 minutes
        -d=30 -D=1
            set downtime starting now for 1 hour and 30 minutes
        -b='Tomorrow 10am' -D=1
            set downtime starting tomorrow at 10am for 1 hour
        -b='Tomorrow 10am' -e='Tomorrow 11am'
            set downtime starting tomorrow at 10am and ending tomorrow at 11am



Specifying services

Services are specified by the -s parameter.  You can specify a single service or multiple services; you can specify -s multiple times or you can specify more than one service with -s quoted space delimited.

    Valid examples
        -s=log_age
        -s='app_log_age app_log_backup'


Modes

Most modes require at a minimum a hostname, and most will accept a service.  The exception is 'query' mode where they are both accepted but not required.
ngctl allows specifying hostnames directly using -h, by specifying a hostgroup using -H, or by using a hostname template and range.  Specifying services can currently only be specified directly; there isn't current support for servicegroups.  Time ranges (start time and end time) can be specified as either absolute times or as an offset from 'now' or an absolute start time.  
See the notes on 'Specifying hostnames', 'Specifying services' and 'Specifying the time frame'.



'down' Mode (add down entries)

This is the default and original mode.  Adds one or more downtime entries for hosts or services on hosts.  A downtime entry needs a host, a start time and an end time and a comment.  Optionally a service can be included.  



'up' Mode (remove downtime entries)

A search is made for downtime entries which match the parameters provided much in the same was as 'down' mode, and those found are deleted.  Durations (-d and -D) are not valid in this mode, however start time and end time parameters (-b and -e) are valid.  Use the -u parameter to only remove entries created by a specific user, or the shortcut --my to only remove entries created by the current user.



'ack' Mode (acknowledge host or service problems)

Used to add an acknowledgement to a host or service problem. Requires one or more hosts and/or services, and a comment.  By default acknowledgements will not produce  notifications and are not 'sticky'.  To enable notifications of acknowledgements specify -n.  To make acknowledgements 'sticky' specify -k.  



Enable and disable modes - ec, en, dc and dn

These modes enable or disable checks or notifications for one or more hosts, or one or more services on hosts.  They are (as listed above):
  ec  enable check(s)           long name: enable-checks
  en  enable notification(s)    long name: enable-notifications
  dc  disable check(s)          long name: disable-checks
  dn  disable notification(s)   long name: disable-notifications

Only hostnames/hostgroups and service names are valid as paramaters.



'sc' Mode (schedule a host or service check)

Long name : schedule-check
Schedules a check of one or more hosts, or one or more services on hosts.  Requires one or more hosts, or one or more services on hosts.
If no time paramaters are provided the default is to schdule checks 10 seconds from 'now'
-b may be specified as an absolute time to schedule the checks.
-d and -D may be used as an offset from 'now'.  For example -d=1 would schedule for 1 minute from 'now'

If a check for the host/service is already schduled with a time sooner than specified the command will not be issued, and ngctl will exit as OK.
Note: ngctl does not use _FORCE_ commands, so caveats apply, see the Nagios External Commands documentation.



'rd' Mode

Removes a downtime by it's ID.  Takes a single parameter, -i=<ID>



'query' Mode

Still to do.  See the ngctlq.conf file for more information.



Tuning command and query speed 

This does not apply to query or rd modes.

Depending on the load on your Nagios server, you might need to throttle how fast commands and queries are made, and how many times to retry. Defaults are set in the script for the parameters which control this behaviour.

    Retries
        There are two retry paramaters, -r specifies the number of times to send a command, and -R specifies the number of times to try and validate each command was successful. For example

        -r=3 -R=2

        would execute the command, and try twice to validate it was successful.  If not successful it will repeat the command and validations up to 3 times before failing.


    Throttling

        There are two parameters which affect the speed commands and queries are sent.
        -z specifies the amount of time to pause after a command has been sent before trying to validate it's success, and how long to wait before trying to validate again.
        -Z specifies the amount of time to pause before sending the next command, after the previous command/validation has completed.

        -z=0.5 -Z=1

        would send the initial command and then pause for 0.5 seconds before querying to validate success, and a further 0.5 seconds before trying to validate again. Once validation is complete (failed or not), ngctl will then pause for 1 second before sending the next command.

Both the retry values and the throttle values work together if you need to tune for your install and your failure tolerance.
